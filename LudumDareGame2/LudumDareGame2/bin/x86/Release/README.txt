Hey fellow Ludum Dare-er, or just plain old game enthusiast.

Thanks for checking out my game, Nothing but Stars. I had a lot of fun making the game,
but unfortunately, ended up missing out on the last 12 hours of work time. I full well
expected to spend those adding obstacles like meteorites, black holes etc. to spicen
up the gameplay. Still, I'm left with an almost decent game with some cool elements
and mechanics to it.

All graphics, audio, and code was made by me with the help of the following tools:

Visual Studio
Paint.net
Reason 4
Sfxr
Audacity

If you would like to use any of my assets, please send me an email at wbobeirne@gmail.com
The code, however, is free for you to learn from.

Thanks again!
